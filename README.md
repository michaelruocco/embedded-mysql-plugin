This plugin is built around the [embedded mysql project](https://github.com/wix/wix-embedded-mysql).
It allows you to easily start up a MySQL process without having to install it by hand. Currently
the plugin only exposes the ability to be able to set the port the process is running on; an
username and a password to use when connecting. There are various other configuration options offered
in the [embedded mysql project](https://github.com/wix/wix-embedded-mysql) that could be exposed with
further development of the plugin if / when required.

## Usage

To use the plugin's functionality, you will need to add the its binary artifact to your build script's
classpath and apply the plugin.

### Adding the plugin binary to the build

The plugin JAR needs to be defined in the classpath of your build script. It is directly available on
[Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/).
The following code snippet shows an example on how to retrieve it from Bintray:

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.michaelruocco:embedded-mysql-plugin:2.1.11'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'embedded-mysql'
```

or alternatively:

```
plugins {
    id 'com.github.michaelruocco.embedded-mysql-plugin' version '2.1.11'
}
```

Kotlin DSL:

```
plugins {
    id("com.github.michaelruocco.embedded-mysql-plugin") version "2.1.11"
}
```

The plugin will add two new tasks to your gradle build:

* startEmbeddedMysql
* stopEmbeddedMysql

### Configuring your embedded MySQL database

It should be fairly obvious what these two tasks do, before you can use them you will need to
configure how you want your mysql to run, you do this by providing properties to the EmbeddedMysqlExtension
as shown below.

```
embeddedMysql {
    url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databaseName'
    username = 'user'
    password = ''
    version = 'v5_7_latest'
}
```
Kotlin DSL:

```
embeddedMysql {
    setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test")
    username = "test"
    password = ""
    setVersion("v5_7_latest")
}
```

Once you have set these properties they will be used to spin up your database so you can connect to
it as you would any other mysql database.

### Setting server variables and charsets

It is also possible to set the charset, collate and server variables against the database configuration
thanks to work done by [kiakimov](https://github.com/kiakimov). An example configuration is shown below:

```
embeddedMysql {
    url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databaseName'
    username = 'user'
    password = ''
    version = 'v5_7_latest'
    serverCharset = 'utf8'
    serverCollate = 'utf8_general_ci'
    serverVars = ['explicit_defaults_for_timestamp' : true]
}
```

### Setting additional schemas

It is also possible to provide an additional schema or even set of schemas. Additional schemas will be created 
by the process among with the default one (taken from connection string). Same username and password can be 
used to access all schemas.

This setup won't create additional schema:

```
embeddedMysql {
    url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databaseName'
    schema = 'databaseName'
    ...
}
```

This setup will create one additional schema:

```
embeddedMysql {
    url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databaseName'
    schema = 'additionalSchema'
    ...
}
```

And this setup will create several additional schemas:

```
embeddedMysql {
    url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databaseName'
    schema = 'additionalSchema1, additionalSchema2'
    ...
}
```

### Setting custom cache directory and download url

It is also possible to configure the cache directory used to run mysql for example if you already have
the version you want to run downloaded and extracted into your project under a directory called custom-mysql-cache
then you could configure the task to run the already downloaded version by adding the following:

```
embeddedMysql {
    url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databaseName'
    username = 'user'
    password = ''
    version = 'v5_7_latest'
    cacheDirectoryPath = 'custom-mysql-cache'
}
```

Obviously you can also provide a full path to a directory if it is not relative to your project. You can also
now specify a base download url, for example if you have a mysql extract stored in a local repository (e.g. your
own nexus or artifactory host) then you can configure the task to download using that repository instead by setting
the base download url property:

```
embeddedMysql {
    url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databaseName'
    username = 'user'
    password = ''
    version = 'v5_7_latest'
    baseDownloadUrl = 'http://my-local-repo/'
}
```

You should note that you cannot specify the full path, and the software will append the
various information for the version you want for you. So given the example above the full url
that would be used is: http://my-local-repo/MySQL-5.6/mysql-5.6.23-osx10.9-x86_64.tar.gz. This
means that you need to follow the standard of creating a directory for your version and then storing
the archive with the default name that would be used when downloading from the central MySQL location
(https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/) directly. This is imposed by the underlying
[embedded mysql project](https://github.com/wix/wix-embedded-mysql) that this plugin uses.

#### Default configuration

The default values for each of the underlying properties are:

* databaseName = '' (empty string, process will not work if a databaseName is not provided)
* port = 3306 (default MySQL port)
* username = 'user'
* password = '' (empty string, this means no password is required to access your embedded MySQL database)
* version = 'v5_7_latest' (default version of MySQL used by this plugin 5.6.22)
* serverCharset = 'utf8mb4'
* serverCollate = 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'
* serverVars = []
* version = 'v5_7_latest'
* cacheDirectoryPath = <users home directory>/.embedmysql
* baseDownloadUrl = 'https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/'
* timeoutSeconds = 30 (default start/stop timeout)
* schema = '' (empty set, process will not create additional schemas and will use 'databaseName')
* tempDir = 'build/mysql-temp/' (default temporary directory)

This means the example configuration above could also be expressed as shown below.

```
embeddedMysql {
    url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databaseName'
}
```

#### Available versions

When selecting a version of MySQL to run you have the following versions currently available:

* v5_5_40
* v5_6_21
* v5_6_22
* v5_6_23
* v5_6_24
* v5_6_latest
* v5_7_10
* v5_7_13
* v5_7_latest

These available versions are exposed by the [embedded mysql project](https://github.com/wix/wix-embedded-mysql)

### Connecting to your embedded MySQL database

Given the example shown above and using the standard MySQL JDBC connector you would connect to
this database using the code shown below.

```
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver")
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/databaseName", "user", "")
```
